# CanJS filter example

A small project for teaching myself some [CanJS](http://canjs.com/) using
can.Component. Filter a small selection of movies either by their **title** or
**#genre**. A key press triggers the filter function, so the filtering feels
quick and responsive.

## Run locally

Using `browser-sync` it's easy to have a local server running the page. Just run
the `npm run dev` script after making sure you have everything installed with
`npm install`. Any changes to `index.html` will refresh the page automatically.
